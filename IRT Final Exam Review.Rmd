\textbf{Lecture 1}

The big picture is that Item Response Theory (IRM), also called Item Response Modeling (IRM), is mainly concerned with the relationship between the probability of a response and the underlying latent dimension.

\begin{align}
P = P(\theta)
\end{align}

This methodology models the Item Characteristics Curve (ICC).

IRT deals with 4 things:

1. \textbf{Postulating Models} that describe the relationship between the probability of response and $\theta$.

2. \textbf{Estimating} these models using an available data set.

3. \textbf{Evaluating Model Fit} and determining which model to select.

4. \textbf{Estimating Individual $\theta$s} based on the model fit for the correct dimensions.

As a result of these 4 steps one has the information to:

1. Characterize estimated parameters for the items.

2. Estimate the amount of the characteristic one exhibits.
